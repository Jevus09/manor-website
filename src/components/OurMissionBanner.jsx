            <h1>Our Mission</h1>
            <p>WELCOME to Lee Manor Rehabilitation and Nursing Center, a 260-bed skilled nursing and rehabilitation facility located at 1301 N. Lee Street in the heart of Des Plaines. Since 1979, our family owned and operated center has been providing dignified, homelike care and assistance for aging members of our community. Because we are a family, we understand the concerns and needs of your family in assuring that those you love enjoy a warm, friendly and secure atmosphere reminiscent of their own homes.
            Unlike a traditional nursing home, our services extend to those requiring a short term stay in our Sub-acute program. With newly designed private rooms, we cater to the needs of patients who may require 24 hour skilled nursing care as well as intensive therapy services. Lee Manor is proud to offer a superb, well rounded array of services and activities to enhance the lives of our residents.</p>
